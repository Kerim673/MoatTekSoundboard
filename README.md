# MoatTekSoundboard
A soundboard meant for annoying other people in the TeamSpeak server.

# Setting Up
1) Build the project, and create a folder called "SoundFiles" in the same directory.
2) Add your desired mp3 files to the folder.

# Known issues
- Adding too many mp3 files will cause the buttons to misbehave
- Pressing the buttons and changing audio devices too quickly will cause the program to crash.
- Pressing a button while another is playing will stop the current playing sound without playing the new one.
- Output devices bar at the bottom looks ugly
